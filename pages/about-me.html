                        To be able to adequately and appropriately write about myself is probably one of the most unprecedented challenges I've faced. Why unprecedented, you ask? Well because I did not expect a CS-based course forcing a student, such as I am, to be here thinking for hours on what is for most a trivial subject. Alas, what a shame. <br>
                        <br>
                        But anyway, let me at least start with what society requires one to write in an "About Me" section: <br>
                        <br>
                        Greetings! My name is Raghav Doshi. At the time of writing (early into 2024 C.E.), I am 18 years of age. Currently I'm pursuing a B.Tech. and M.S. by Research in Computer Science under the CSD [Dual Degree] program at the International Institute of Information Techonology [IIITH]<br>
                        <br>
                        Now for some random information about myself that no one quite asked for:<br>
                        I'm a reader at heart. Books (and coffee) have been some of the biggest parts of my existence upto this point, and I hold them dear to my heart. I tend to enjoy the dry bits of humour and wit that so distinctly set out good books from their peers. I constantly look out for new pieces of knowledge, hoarding them akin to how dragons hoard trinkets. Did I mention I'm really into books? <br>
                        <br>

                        I present a nice piece of art, <a href="../resources/random_painting.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> [Credits do not go to me, do not ask me where I found this]
                    </p>
